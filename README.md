# *Mario-Like Game*

*video link*

* **Gane Description**
  * **What is the main action in the game**
  
The game is a Mario-like platformer, where you can break blocks by jumping under them and smash enemies by jumping ontop of them. There are also powerups like in mario that will grant you an extra life if an enemy catches you. The point of the game is just to get to the other side of the level, There is only 2 levels for this project.
  * **What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal**
  
Unreal is a fantastic tool, however it's more aimed at third person and first person games. Simply getting the Side Scrolling camera how I wanted it was quite a mission. I ran into a lot of bugs with the Spring Arm component and the Camera component. For Example, when my player would turn backwards, the camera would for some reason zoom in really close. This was because the camera is aimed towards third person views, where you want it to move around with the player.
  * **What is the most interesting part of the game**
  
The most interesting part of my game is easily the *unqiue* sound effects. I recorded the soundtrack and all the sound effects (running, jumping) myself and had **a lot** of fun doing it. I believe my game needed something to be different, as there are a ton of mario clones out there. It needed something like my goofy sound effects to be different.
